# Ch.1 Ten Principles of Economics

- Economists normally assume that people are rational. Rational people systemati-
  cally and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives, given the 
  available opportunities. 
- Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but usu-
  ally involve shades of gray
- most policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is divided
- market failure to refer to a situation in which the market on its own fails to produce an efficient allocation of resources.
- pardon me, Willie, but are we worse off because of the job losses in agriculture? the would-have-been farmers are now college professors and computer gurus.
