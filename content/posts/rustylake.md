===

Rusty lake is a thrilling game series with many secrets in them. Animal characters, shadow person, religious elements, murders... A thriller is too less to cover the topic of rusty lake, and what I am intent to do, is to reveal the prossible secrest hidden behind the screen...

The lake's goal is to find the 5 objects: 

- apple
- coin
- gem
- shell
- eye

and attach them all on the tree at corresponding position. Some interesting thing happened in-between:

- the tree comes out from a fish
- using mold as bait, we fished a dead body 
- magnet attracts a chest requiring code from [The Season]({{< ref  "rustylake.md#the-season" >}})
